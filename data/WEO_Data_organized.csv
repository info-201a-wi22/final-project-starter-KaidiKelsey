359,PRI,Puerto Rico,North America,"Gross domestic product corresponding to fiscal year, current prices",National currency,Billions,"Source: Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico; and Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan Latest actual data: FY2019/20 Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plans (FEGPs), latest of which were prepared in August 2021,  and are certified by the Financial Oversight and Management Board. The 2021 Fiscal Plan calls for a series of structural reforms, such as Earned Income Tax Credit benefits and Natural Assistance Program (NAP), lowering barriers to entry for foreign firms, investment in education, power sector, and infrastructure. The new fiscal plan also pays particular attention at allocating strategic investment to emergency response and frontline service delivery, as the island is highly vulnerable to  natural disasters and battling an ongoing pandemic. This plan represents an unprecedented level of fiscal support - over 100% of Puerto Rico's national gross product. The Fiscal Plan finally focuses on the implementation of fiscal measures (centralizing fiscal authority, agencies efficiency, Medicaid reform, pension reform, reduction of appropriations, enhanced tax compliance and optimized taxes and fees) that would result in a smaller government deficit in the long term. IMF fiscal projections rely on the  information presented above, as well as on the assumption that the fiscal position will deteriorate over time. Previous WEO submissions (prior to Fall 2021), on the other hand,  relied on the assumption of fiscal consolidation. Although IMF policy assumptions are similar to those in the FEGP scenario with full measures, the IMF's projections of fiscal revenues, expenditures, and balance are different from the FEGPs'. This stems from two main differences in methodologies: first, while IMF projections are on an accrual basis, the FEGPs' are on a cash basis. Second, the IMF and FEGPs make very different macroeconomic assumptions. Start/end months of reporting year: July/June GFS Manual used: Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001 Basis of recording: Accrual. IMF calculations are based on an accrual basis, whereas authorities' calculations are based on a cash basis. General government includes: General government is defined as all general governmental entities, excluding Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA). General government entities include the General Fund, Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA), Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA), Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO), Highways and Transportation Authority (HTA), University of Puerto Rico (UPR), Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico (GDB), and Municipal Revenues Collection Center (CRIM). In addition, pension funds (ERS, TRS, and JRS) are also considered as part of general government. Valuation of public debt: Current market value. Data for public debt have been provided by the authorities. The definition of government for public debt data excludes PREPA and PRASA and includes all other entities of general government in fiscal accounts.
